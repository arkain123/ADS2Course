 Oh my god, I remember you from day one. The day I started osu! seriously, on my off-time I went to the streams page and you were there, doing maps like Jump Final Boss AR10 (I wasn't there for that specific stream, but it was around that time)

I have no idea what you prefer to be called. Cook? Jacky? Matt? I have this thing where I tend to call many people by their real names, so I'll stick with Matt.

I've donated in the past to you, for sure, once or twice; and you're one of the VERY few people I actually really did donate to (not because I didn't want to donate to all the other lovely streamers I watched, but simply because I was too lazy to get off of my ass and go to the local 7-11 to get a prepaid visa or mastercard). The times have flown; I can remember the days of being a scrub struggling with AR8/9 around mid to late 2014 when I first joined the game, and every day after I felt like I had had enough of playing the actual game I often went straight to the livestreams page, and I visited your stream along with Leevi (thelewa)'s, Remco (HappyStick)'s, and maybe Alex (Azer)'s a bit, but both yours and Lewa's were the most frequented.

I can barely remember what rank you were back then, but I think it was...65? Somewhere in the 60-100 range, you were definitely well over top 200 at one point, if not top 100. Now, you're not even 400 after all these years, and you're not the only one who feels like an old man as a result. Though I've been here in the community for about 2 and a half years, I too, feel ancient. I've seen a lot of shit, from the attempted OWC boycott in 2014 to the Free Happystick Fiasco all the way through countless pages and pages of reddit drama.

I'll always remember you as one of the very first players I looked up to, and still continue to to this day; the effort you put into the game for your time was absolutely legendary.

Go kick ass at doing backflips and make every prestigious German uni test your bitch, because I know if you can kick that much ass at a rhythm game you can certainly apply it to academics as well. Oh, and I know countless people will agree with me, but as someone that's openly bisexual, you are fucking lavishly hot. Just thought I'd leave that there~
